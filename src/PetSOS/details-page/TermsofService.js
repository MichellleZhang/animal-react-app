                        The Website may make certain services available related to finding a lost pet, posting information about a found pet, or adopting a pet (“Services”) and allow you to set up an account or become a registered user to access the Services. In such cases, if you 18 years old or older, you may register to become a registered user through the Website (“Registered User”). You are responsible for all activity under your Registered User account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information at all times, and to update it in a timely manner. You must keep the Registered User username and password confidential, and you may not transfer or otherwise do anything to give another person access to your Registered User account. You must notify us immediately at support if you become aware that anyone has gained unauthorized access to your Registered User account. You represent and warrant that all information you provide as a Registered User is accurate and complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate any Registered User at any time if we suspect that you have not complied with these Terms or for other reasons that we determine in good faith are necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to, if we suspect you are using or attempting to use the Website in any way that violates these Terms or any applicable laws or regulations.
                    </p>
                    <li> User Content</li>

                        If you submit User Content to the Website, you grant PetSOS an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, unrestricted license (with the right to sublicense the rights) to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, and publicly display and perform User Content in whole or in part in any media now known or later developed.</p>
                    <p>When you submit any User Content, you represent and warrant that (A) you have the right and authority to submit it (for instance, you took the picture of your pet) and you have obtained all rights and consents necessary to grant this license; (B) all User Content is accurate; (C) User Content does not and will not violate any third party’s copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, right to privacy or publicity, or any other proprietary, personal, or other right of any kind; (D) you are under no obligation that would in any way interfere with the disclosure or use of User Content; and (E) no User Content contains any material or information considered confidential or provided with the understanding that it would not be disclosed or published.</p>
